# **NOT-Whatsapp chat app**
Want to chat with your friends but don't want to sell your data to Mark Zuckerberg?
We got you with the latest Whatapp lookalike app.

### What can you do in our app?
Currently our app is fully functional, but the data gets deleted if you refresh it.
The will persist even if you logout - meaning you can have a conversation between two users if you logout and switch between them as long as you don't refresh the page.

### How can you run our app?
To run our app please clone our repository and then execute the following commands from the repository's folder:
```
cd client-side
npm install
npm start
```
a tab of your default browser is supposed to open with the URL localhost:3000/

### localDB
to help with the testing we created a local DB containing 13 users, all the users have a conversation with user1.
you can login to our fake users with the following credentials:

username - user1 password - user1

username - user2 password - user2

....
username - user13 password - user13.

feel free to use our DB as you WISH :)
